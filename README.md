This is HPIPM, a high-performance interior-point method solver for dense, optimal control- and tree-structured convex quadratic programs. It provides efficient implementations of dense and structure-exploiting algorithms to solve small to medium scale problems arising in model predictive control and embedded optimization in general and it relies on the high-performance linear algebra package BLASFEO.
